// TODO: in engine.js, at line 190, add a health bar for player
//       fill it in red as the player loses lives. it must be in proportion
//       to the length of the bar and to the total number of lives
//       position it to cover the bottom part of the grass tiles at the bottom
//       width / total number of lives -> unit of the bar
//       initially the bar is green. every time a live is lost, one unit becomes red

// TODO: the game could consist in having to get to the top grass line to fetch something and 
//       then bring it back to the bottom grass line.
//       it could be just any object, but it could also be letters, randomly posted, to make real words
//       words would have to be validated against an authority, say cambridge or wm

// TODO: at game over, do NOT reset the player, leave it where it "died"

// TODO: the "feature" of a random sprite could be 'inherent' to the Prize class
//       bring the random choice of sprite inside the Prize object
