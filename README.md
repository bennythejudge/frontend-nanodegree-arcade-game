How to:
There are various ways to execute this game depending on your configuration. 
The base minimum suggested method is to execute a minimal web server via
python:
1) download the game from github
2) cd into the game directory
3) execute python -m SimpleHTTPServer
4) check for the message "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 8000 ..." 
5) open your browser and use the url: http://localhost:8000 if the number above is not 8000,
   use that number instead.
