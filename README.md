Second submission - notes
I have reviewed the project on the base of your remarks and I am submitting the project for a 2nd attempt.
The changes have been made under a branch named 2nd-attempt in the same repository:
https://github.com/bennythejudge/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
After making the changes, I have merged the branch to the master.
Please find here some additional notes on the submission:
1. Game Functions
Although I have considered your Suggestion, I hope you will understand that I have chosen not to act on this aspect since you graded this section "Exceeds specifications". I wish I had time to improve the game which is really basic and not very challenging or entertaining, but due to chronic and persistent lack of time, I have to force myself to leave it as it is.
I also confess having hit a "creative" roadblock probably induced by the pressure of the coming projects and deadlines.

2. Code Quality
I have now added the missing semicolons. I have reviewed the variable names.
I have replaced all double-quotes with single quotes.
I have cleaned up the comments and removed the debugging lines that had been left commented.
